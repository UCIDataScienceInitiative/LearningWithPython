Generators allow us to only pass a small portion of the data at a time so it doesn't use all the memory from the computer.

It uses a generator because the modifications are done on the fly and it would take too much memory to save the augmented dataset. Keras also provides us with a method to fit the model when we use a generator, fit_generator(). This method requires us to specify how many batches are equivalent to an epoch so the model knows when to do updates, otherwise since the generator loops through the data, it would go on training infinitely."
